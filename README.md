The Tools I used when making this dashboard include: 
1. Power BI Desktop
2. DAX (CALENDAR, ADDCOLUMNS, EOMONTH)
3. Visualizations: Line chart, bar chart, map, donut chart, KPI cards

Through this dashboard, I learnt a few things such as : 
1. How to build a time-based Date Table from scratch using DAX
2. Refreshing Power BI skills after a long break
3. Creating clear and user-friendly visual layouts
4. Using conditional formatting for visual cues (profit levels)
